# FoodDiff: A Collaborative Relationship Perception Framework for Food Image Synthesis using Diffusion Models

## ðŸ“š Introduction
We propose FoodDiff, a collaborative relationship-aware diffusion model for food imagegeneration, which consists of three key components: (1) a collaborativerelation module to extract these relations and inject them intothe image generation process. (2) a recipe fusion fine-tuning module to precisely fuserecipe semantics with visual features and fine-tune the  pre-trained model. (3) an image rewardfeedback mechanism to optimize the aesthetics of food images. 
There are some examples.
